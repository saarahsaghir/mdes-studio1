Like most young children, I’ve had my fair share of outdoor adventures. Sometime in the summer of 1999 there is a little girl in bedazzled overalls examining a glittery trail on the sidewalk, wondering if that snail is really a fairy in disguise (<i>why else would it be shedding fairy dust?</i>). Rocks from the playground transformed into magical gems, and birds flying overhead became important messengers in my imagined stories of the animal world. My curiosity expanded far beyond creating stories, and my parents were ever too happy to indulge me in my quest to figure out how and why nature worked the way it did. I was fascinated by the patterns I found in nature, from snowflakes on the window to the spots on the ladybugs I held. My mother and I would spend long hours asking each other questions about whatever caught our interest in the backyard or the park, and when we had come up with enough theories, we’d head to the library to see what we could learn. Nature and animals are a significant aspect of many children’s books, both fiction and nonfiction, and I am grateful to have grown up with a balanced view of both the scientific and the imagined representations of the natural world.

Stories of the natural world evoke within us a sense of <i>wildness</i> and of <i>wonder</i>

Our story, as humans, is the “story of our relationship with nature.”<sup>1</sup> While historically, our relationship has become troubled, in recent times it has made a move towards interdependency. Stories, which are fundamental to our human experience, can help make this shift to a balanced view of nature, by evoking within us a sense of <i>wildness</i> and of <i>wonder</i>.<sup>2</sup> Many of us are quite removed from nature and have not experienced the true wildness of it — the feeling of something grander, something that exists outside of our control, and yet has its own patterns and orders. I believe this is one reason for the way our society has become indifferent towards nature. Perhaps now that we have become disconnected from it, we no longer realize that we cannot expect the natural world to fit within our human rules and patterns. This awareness begins in childhood, when we are first learning about the world and becoming curious about the way it works.<sup>3</sup> Imaginative play, especially within nature, is crucial in developing our perspectives of the world.<sup>4</sup> In this way, it helps to <i>environmentally socialize</i> children, which is to teach them about the environment by modelling “positive perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards the environment.”<sup>5</sup>

Growing up in a small town, I was lucky to have a deep connection with nature throughout the years. My summers were spent hiking the wooded trails near the river, and my autumns were spent running through the leafy undergrowth of the forest. As children, my sister and I would spend hours in the open grassy field behind our house, imagining all sorts of adventures as we crept up to butterflies and birds. Every spring, baby frogs would emerge under the flickering street lights and we would take turns “rescuing” them from cars. And in the winters, at the nature centre I volunteered at, we would turn sap into maple syrup and freeze it in the freshly fallen snow. This “easy relationship,” as Elliott calls it, established the natural world as a “place of bounty, beauty and safety.”<sup>6</sup>

As I grew older, my fascination with nature evolved into an interest in its stewardship and conservation. I realized that these experiences are not always accessible within urban environments. Many developed are “human constructions in which nature is held at bay.”<sup>7</sup> The Greater Toronto Area does address this issue quite well in comparison to other cities, as there are green spaces well spread throughout—“Canadians are not afraid of nature, and cities are not garrisons…there is as much of nature in the city as there is out of it.”<sup>8</sup> However, as in any city, we are not as immersed in nature. In my undergraduate thesis, I addressed how this lack of immersion creates an atmosphere where even people who are interested in conservation and stewardship are not able to connect to the wildlife around them — we often champion for far-flung animals and causes, not knowing that there is so much to do right at home. My work focused on creating a system to encourage people to foster wildlife in their own backyard or balcony, creating a deeper connection with nature in our daily lives. Cities, after all, exist within nature like the rest of us.

The magic of nature, especially in our urban landscape, lies in its discovery. Like in Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic <i>The Secret Garden</i>, discovering nature, especially as a child, is like holding a key that unlocks your imagination. Elliott argues that <i>The Secret Garden</i> could be used to create “a model for discovery within, and reclamation of, the urban environment.”<sup>9</sup> The unexpected ways in which nature climbs into our city lives compel us to question, investigate, and form our own stories. This spark of curiosity and imagination is essential to foster a positive relationship with nature, and instill a sense of responsibility and the importance of environmental stewardship.

Incidental and unplanned encounters with nature are the inspiration for much of my work. These encounters may be mundane, like a line of geese marching across the road, or extraordinary, like catching a glimpse of an eagle soaring in the sky. My aim is to instill a sense of wonder and curiosity through my work, through visual storytelling that invites discovery.

The visual stories of nature I explored in my work this term revolved around the ways in which humans, and our built environment, interact with the natural world and its environment. Manmade forms, like geometric shapes and letterforms, intersect with the natural forms and organic shapes of wings and trees. I especially found myself drawn towards branching patterns, like the veins of a leaf or on a dragonfly wing, which look both organic and geometric. Typographically, I experimented with molding the uniform and geometric letters into flowing, organic forms.

The best way to examine our relationship with the natural world is to examine the stories we tell of our encounters with it, and the way nature and animals are constructed within these stories.<sup>10</sup> These stories may be in the form of urban legends, or new scientific discoveries. Historically, nature and wildlife have been depicted in folklore, fairytales, myths, and legends. These are often positioned as children’s stories, but they are quite telling of our human experience and cultures as a whole. Within illustrated books, the visual design of characters, places, and typography play a significant role in our perception of the natural world and the way we use it to “understand, add meaning to, and cope with our lives.”<sup>11</sup> Even as we have outgrown the forest villages of the past, our new modern cities aren’t as far from nature and wildlife as we would like to think. My final illustrations explore the kinds of stories that could be imagined in the modern world, at the intersection of city life and wild life.
