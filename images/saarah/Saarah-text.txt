URBAN STORIES OF HUMANS & NATURE

There is something inherently wondrous about the natural world. When coupled with childish curiosity and a bit of imagination, its mysteries transform into marvelous worlds.

<p>Like most young children, I’ve had my fair share of outdoor adventures. Sometime in the summer of 1999 there is a little girl in bedazzled overalls examining a glittery trail on the sidewalk, wondering if that snail is really a fairy in disguise (why else would it be shedding fairy dust?). Rocks from the playground transformed into magical gems, and birds flying overhead became important messengers in my imagined stories of the animal world. My curiosity expanded far beyond creating stories, and my parents were ever too happy to indulge me in my quest to figure out how and why nature worked the way it did. I was fascinated by the patterns I found in nature, from snowflakes on the window to the spots on the ladybugs I held. My mother and I would spend long hours asking each other questions about whatever caught our interest in the backyard or the park, and when we had come up with enough theories, we’d head to the library to see what we could learn. Nature and animals are a significant aspect of many children’s books, both fiction and nonfiction, and I am grateful to have grown up with a balanced view of both the scientific and the imagined representations of the natural world.</p>

<p>Our story, as humans, is the “story of our relationship with nature <sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Strickland, Tessa. 2009. “Stones, Woods and Water: Deep Ecology and Children’s Literature.” IBBYLink, 2009.">1</a></sup>.” While historically, our relationship has become troubled, in recent times it has made a move towards interdependency. Stories, which are fundamental to our human experience, can help make this shift to a balanced view of nature, by evoking within us a sense of <b>wildness</b> and of <b>wonder</b><sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Strickland, Tessa. 2009. “Stones, Woods and Water: Deep Ecology and Children’s Literature.” IBBYLink, 2009.">2</a></sup>. Many of us are quite removed from nature and have not experienced the true wildness of it — the feeling of something grander, something that exists outside of our control, and yet has its own patterns and orders. I believe this is one reason for the way our society has become indifferent towards nature. Perhaps now that we have become disconnected from it, we no longer realize that we cannot expect the natural world to fit within our human rules and patterns. This awareness begins in childhood, when we are first learning about the world and becoming curious about the way it works<sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Strickland, Tessa. 2009. “Stones, Woods and Water: Deep Ecology and Children’s Literature.” IBBYLink, 2009.">3</a></sup>. Imaginative play, especially within nature, are crucial in developing our perspectives of the world<sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Strickland, Tessa. 2009. “Stones, Woods and Water: Deep Ecology and Children’s Literature.” IBBYLink, 2009.">4</a></sup>. In this way, it helps to environmentally socialize children, which is to teach them about the environment by modeling “positive perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards the environment <sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Boudreaux, Becky. 2007. “The Representation of the Environment in Children’s Literature.”">5</a></sup>.”</p>

<p>Growing up in a small town, I was lucky to have a deep connection with nature throughout the years. My summers were spent hiking the wooded trails near the river, and my autumns were spent running through the leafy undergrowth of the forest. As children, my sister and I would spend hours in the open grassy field behind our house, imagining all sorts of adventures as we crept up to butterflies and birds. Every spring, baby frogs would emerge under the flickering street lights and we would take turns “rescuing” them from cars. And in the winters, at the nature centre I volunteered at, we would turn sap into maple syrup and freeze it in the freshly fallen snow. This “easy relationship,” as Elliott calls it, established the natural world as a “place of bounty, beauty and safety <sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elliott, Zetta. 2009. “Telling Secrets in the City: Narrative Possibility and the Urban Environment.” IBBYLink, 2009.">6</a></sup>.”</p>

<p>As I grew older, my fascination with nature evolved into an interest in its stewardship and conservation. I realized that these experiences are not always accessible within urban environments. The Greater Toronto Area does address this issue quite well in comparison to other cities, as there are green spaces well spread throughout, but as in any city, we are not as immersed in nature. In my undergraduate thesis, I addressed how this lack of immersion creates an atmosphere where even people who are interested in conservation and stewardship are not able to connect to the wildlife around them — we often champion for far-flung animals and causes, not knowing that there is so much to do right at home. My work focused on creating a system to encourage people to foster wildlife in their own backyard or balcony, creating a deeper connection with nature in our daily lives. Cities, after all, exist within nature like the rest of us.</p>

<p>The magic of nature lies in its discovery. Like in Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic <i>The Secret Garden</i>, discovering nature, especially as a child, is like holding a key that unlocks your imagination. Elliott argues that <i>The Secret Garden</i> could be used to create “a model for discovery within, and reclamation of, the urban environment<sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elliott, Zetta. 2009. “Telling Secrets in the City: Narrative Possibility and the Urban Environment.” IBBYLink, 2009.">7</a></sup>..”</p>

<p>Much of my personal work resonates with this sentiment. The themes of wonder, discovery, and curiosity within nature are recurring themes. Here, I have explored these through collage, typography, and illustration. In my collages, I explore the human/nature relationship and the cultural aspects of it. Typographical experimentation focused on the patterns of nature, and my illustration work brings both of these together, exploring the ways in which nature has been depicted and discussed within stories, especially folklore, fairytales, and legends, both modern and historical.</p>
