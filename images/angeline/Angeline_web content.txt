Essay Text

Millions of people are losing their lives at this very moment due to lack of access to food, water, and electricity. Cities like Houston, states like Puerto Rico and countries like the Philippines have been severely flooded and destroyed by hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. It is predicted that the city of Miami will be flooded in less than 50 years<sup>1</sup>. In fact, Miami is already struggling with floods and is spending millions of dollars simply in an effort to raise the level of their roads1. How many more people will have to die before we decide to take action? In this article, I will uncover how our diet is the biggest cause of climate change. Secondly, I will explain how the changing consumer is revolutionizing the food industry. Finally, I will be presenting carbon labeling as a design solution to create transparency between consumers and the food industry.

Many people are unaware that the leading cause of climate change is animal agriculture. In fact, Pull Quote:<i>it takes</i> <b>2,000 gallons of water</b> <i>to make</i> <b>a single pound of beef</b><sup>2</sup>.

Moreover, it is illegal to market eggs as healthy and studies have proven that eating a single egg is the equivalent to smoking five cigarettes<sup>3</sup>. The meat and dairy industries are funding studies that argue that sugar is the cause of diabetes in the United States. However, evidence suggests that the leading cause of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart attacks is fat found in meat<sup>3</sup>. <i>Can design be part of a solution rather than just an advertising tool for capitalism? Can design encourage the consumer to question his or her own habits? In other words, can design make a difference?</i>Archeology has shown that human design dates back to our earliest primitive origins. Humans have always designed their future. Therefore, designing is part of human nature and in redesigning the world, we are inevitably changing and improving ourselves. “Ecological design is an emerging field that aims to recalibrate what humans do in the world according to how the world works as a biophysical system. Design in this sense is a large concept having to do as much with politics and ethics as with buildings and technology”<sup>4</sup>. (Orr 2005, p.3) At present, humans seem to be designing their own extinction with overpopulation and climate change. However, the solution could very well be to use design as a tool to save us from this fate.

The biggest change in the food industry is the emergence of the new consumer. There’s a shift that is taking place in the food industry. People are opting for more healthy choices. This shift has had a profound impact on the food industry, particularly as it relates to consumers’ quests for more fresh, natural, organic, and practical foods. Large companies are shifting to selling plant-based products. For example there is the world’s very first “bleeding” veggie burger from Impossible Foods. Consumers have become so much more educated and they are much more aware of the relationship between food and well being, not only in terms of health and wellness, but for our planet as well. In the United States alone, there are close to 80 million people who make up the millennial generation<sup>5</sup>. Families composed of a mom, dad, and two kids represent only around 24% of the population. Now there are other types of households such as single adult households, multi-generational and multicultural households, and even same-sex parents or single mother households. Every one of these households or generations has different eating habits, shops differently, and thinks differently about food. As a millennial, I understand how the new consumer thinks differently about food. Companies now need to cater to the millennial generation, as it has become their main target market. 

Pull Quote:Buying is like <i><b>voting</i></b>. Every time we purchase a product at the grocery store, we are essentially <i><b>voting</i><b> for that product. 

For example if we buy a steak, we are supporting the meat industry. <i>How can design create transparency for consumers?</i> If we can design a long-term solution to protect our environment, then consumers can adapt to the new standards that we establish. The food industry does not want carbon labeling. Labeling in general is a threat to these industries. Thirty years ago, nutrition facts and labeling at restaurants were unheard of. Today, almost every restaurant has a nutrition facts page on its websites. Menus now list the number of calories in each dish. Carbon labeling already exists mainly in Europe. There are two major certification bodies: KRAV and the Swedish Seal were the first to develop a countrywide climate label policy for food<sup>6</sup>. Today, the U.K., France, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and even Japan, Australia, Thailand and South Korea have developed carbon labels which indicate carbon footprint in the form of CO2 equivalent<sup>7</sup>.

We need to introduce carbon labeling as well as support mandatory federal GMO labeling to set a new bar for transparency. It is time to reinvent the nutrition labels on food and identify the carbon emissions from that specific product. The U.K and Sweden have shown climate change initiatives that prove that this concept can be implemented, and, with the assistance of governments and industry, carbon labeling can be established on a larger scale. It is not a question of whether or not carbon labeling will be introduced in North America, but rather when it will arrive. 

To summarize, my goal is to create a long-term solution that consumers will adapt to. I want to make carbon footprint information easy to understand. I don’t think that we should limit this to the food industry; I believe that this should start in grocery stores and expand to every consumer good such as clothes, books, makeup, accessories and even cars. Design allows us to rethink what is considered “normal”. I want consumers to realize that

a plant-based diet <i><b>cuts</i></b> carbon footprint by <b>50%</b><sup>2</sup>.

We must consider technology both as a problem and as a solution. While we might have used technology to design our own pathway to extinction, we can also use technology to design a solution for our species and the planet. <i>“What if design is only design inasmuch as it challenges contemporary definitions of human?</i> There ought to be recognition of precariousness as a shared condition of human life (indeed as a condition that links human and non-human animals)… Precariousness implies living socially, that is, the fact that one’s life is always in some sense in the hands of the other”8. (Colomina & Wigley 2016, p.107-124) <i>How can we demystify the idea of our dependency on others?</i> The common element between humans is the planet. If designers do not step up to this challenge, it is likely that no one will.
