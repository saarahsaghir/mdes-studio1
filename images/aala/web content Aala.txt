Essay Text

This essay explores the design of language, meaning and space. It attempts to find bridges between those concepts in relation to personal experiences of cultural hybridity, multifaceted identity and changing narratives. The work produced looks to explore these cross sections and it looks to visualize them through the mediums of space and typography, both in two dimensional and three dimensional forms. These explorations have been influenced by works of literature on identity, space and culture by writers in a diaspora such as Stuart Hall, Safia AlHillo, Georges Perec on his explorations of space and the theories of Roland Barthes in relation to semiotics. Ultimately the questions asked are how might we explore how designed space provides an opportunity for meaning to emerge? How might we bring physicality to these topics of meaning, language and cultural hybridity through design? And how does their being subjective affect this? How might a designed space respond to the subjectivity of experience? How might it through design allow for that subjectivity?

The multiplicity of culture and language is more than often a large part of the current identity. In relation to language we become basins for all the words, expressions and cultural proverbs that we borrow and that borrow us through time. Words have multiple layers of meaning because of an interweaving of cultures and languages. Our memories are triggered by an ever growing world of things. As an experience this becomes a multifaceted and sometimes confused existence. This is to say that we become multilayered. We reside in the intersection of a complex influx Venn diagram. This space is embedded in reality in the spaces we inhabit and our relationships.

My work began as an investigation of these topics of interest, as a method of visual research. Ultimately, they are an investigation of language for the bilingual speaker. They explore the abstraction of type and the flexibility of language. At some points language and text become visual forms which hold no meaning and at others they become bursts of memory. These explorations take from Perec’s ideas in ‘Species of Spaces’ where he states that ‘this is how space begins, with words only, signs traced on the blank page.”<sup>3</sup> In addition to space, Perec’s works also explore themes of identity, loss and absence. His use of language as a play, and as a game allowed for his mapping of the spaces around us, moving from the most intimate to the public. Perhaps, Perec is an influence for the connections between language, space and experience.

In that he states “The text is not a coexistence of meanings but a passage, an overcrossing; thus it answers not to an interpretation, even a liberal one but to an explosion, a dissemination.” If we were to consider this as a description of space, it brings up questions of how space might allow meaning to emerge and how sense of place is ultimately created through the “stereographic plurality of its weave.”<sup>1</sup>Similar to text, space is also a tissue, a woven fabric of both physical and non-physical stimulants. The meaning generated within that space or in the cross-sections of spaces, similar to culture is performative in its nature, perhaps at a much faster and momentary pace.

This is interesting in relation to the cross-sections of Arabic and English meanings and translation. How can the freedom of language give the reader the opportunity to generate their own multiple meanings from text? By recognizing the power of language to shape and reshape our own individual realities, how can that be applied to an exploration of bilingual hybridity? 
In an attempt to bridge this to identity, In ‘Minimal Selves’ Stuart Hall expresses that ‘identity insists on difference…every identity is placed positioned, in a culture, a language and a history.”<sup>2</sup> He describes this difference as the production of a ‘new space’ for identity. It is interesting that he uses the words, ‘placed’ and ‘positioned’ which allow for some physicality to the concept of identity, this provides the possibility for the exploration of space and place making for a diaspora. Hall further expands on this notion of difference in forming identity:“Identity is formed at the unstable point where the ‘unspeakable’ stories of subjectivity meet the narratives of history, of a culture. And since he/she is positioned in relation to cultured narratives which have been profoundly expropriated the colonized subject is always somewhere else’ doubly marginalized, displaced always other than where he or she is, or is able to speak from.”<sup>2</sup>Hall uses himself as a case study for his work which was developed over the course of decades with a particular political and social culture and historical context. His idea of ‘unspeakable’ stories and the meeting of narratives of history at an unstable point provides an intangible complexity to the diaspora identity. This complexity places challenges for the emergence of meaning through space or through design. Moreover, What is interesting in this is how an individual’s experience can be relatable to many in the diaspora. Identity is multifaceted and while personal, it is also shared. “Many people recognize themselves in the narratives of displacement,”<sup>2</sup> but also “all identity is constructed across difference and begins to live with the politics of difference.”<sup>2</sup>This is ultimately why bilingual culture feeds into this creation of meaning and of the experience of space. There is a space where English and Arabic become seamless however, more than often this translation fails and that mirrors our experiences with the overlap of languages. Sometimes we do not survive translation, there is a difficulty in expression and there are glitches that occur in a bilingual mind. Similarly, Sudanese- American poet Safia AlHillo, looks at the cross-sections of language and identity, she explores the work of various hybrid poets where:“English is the vehicle for the work, but not a characteristic of the contained message. This subversive act of appropriating a language once considered property of the orientalist divide, to express the [Eastern] Other’s point of view. This point of view goes on to alter the language it employs by mutating this language to express concepts that may not be native to the world which this language usually represents.”<sup>4</sup>AlHilo and other writers of diaspora have pondered this use of the colonialist’s language to express notions that are ‘foreign’. This loss in translation is an area worth exploring in relation to design. There is an adaptation of language that is not always successful, these writers borrow the English language with an attempt to mould it into their own method of expression. There are questions here about how culture is borrowed and how that relates to my questions of cultural hybridity? In a way cultural hybridity come to exists because of this borrowing. AlHillo also expands on concepts of home; “Home is not a ready-made location, determined by one’s birth, but an active construction.”<sup>4</sup> AlHillo presents the option of “home as a portable environment… a decision, a project, rather than a country.”<sup>4</sup> This transformative and elusive nature of home can perhaps be translated into a physical experience, which would then allow for the design of space and place.

How does this recreation of culture through language by a diaspora affect experience of place? In Micheal Rock’s ‘Graphic Design in the Expanded field’, he explains that graphic design has allowed for “the activation do spaces, sometimes temporarily and its power lies in that it is temporary as opposed to the seeming permanence of architecture”.<sup>5</sup>  Looking at this through the lens of cultural hybridity how can how design can shape spatial and social interactions of space? And how can language influence semiotic moments linked to the narrative of a space? Design, like Barthes’ text can create conditions for something to emerge. I am interested in this idea of creative production being a culturally and socially transformative medium. This is the key influence on my interests for my thesis, the idea of meaning emerging through space or through design. My background and unfixed identity plays a large role in how this meaning is entirely illusive in nature and subjective to the person within the experience. We inherently absorb things that occur around us to the point where they ultimately become a part of who we are, which relate to AlHillo’s ideas of home being a constructed place. How might I as a designer and a researcher respond to this performative nature of place making and generative meaning within a public of diaspora.
