It is predicted that the city of Miami will be flooded in less than 50 years<sup>1</sup>. In fact, Miami is already struggling with floods and is spending millions of dollars simply in an effort to raise the level of their roads1. How many more people will have to die before we decide to take action? In this article, I will uncover how our diet is the biggest cause of climate change. Secondly, I will explain how the changing consumer is revolutionizing the food industry. Finally, I will be presenting carbon labeling as a design solution to create transparency between consumers and the food industry. Many people are unaware that the leading cause of climate change is animal agriculture. In fact,

The meat and dairy industries are funding studies that argue that sugar is the cause of diabetes in the United States. However, evidence suggests that the leading cause of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart attacks is fat found in meat<sup>3</sup>. <br>

                            <i>Can design be part of a solution rather than just an advertising tool for capitalism? Can design encourage the consumer to question his or her own habits? In other words, can design make a difference?</i> Archeology has shown that human design dates back to our earliest primitive origins. Humans have always designed their future. Therefore, designing is part of human nature and in redesigning the world, we are inevitably changing and improving ourselves. “Ecological design is an emerging field that aims to recalibrate what humans do in the world according to how the world works as a biophysical system. Design in this sense is a large concept having to do as much with politics and ethics as with buildings and technology”<sup>4</sup>. (Orr 2005, p.3) At present, humans seem to be designing their own extinction with overpopulation and climate change. However, the solution could very well be to use design as a tool to save us from this fate.

                                The biggest change in the food industry is the emergence of the new consumer. There’s a shift that is taking place in the food industry. People are opting for more healthy choices. This shift has had a profound impact on the food industry, particularly as it relates to consumers’ quests for more fresh, natural, organic, and practical foods. Large companies are shifting to selling plant-based products. For example there is the world’s very first “bleeding” veggie burger from Impossible Foods. Consumers have become so much more educated and they are much more aware of the relationship between food and well being, not only in terms of health and wellness, but for our planet as well. In the United States alone, there are close to 80 million people who make up the millennial generation<sup>5</sup>. Families composed of a mom, dad, and two kids represent only around 24% of the population. Now there are other types of households such as single adult households, multi-generational and multicultural households, and even same-sex parents or single mother households. Every one of these households or generations has different eating habits, shops differently, and thinks differently about food. As a millennial, I understand how the new consumer thinks differently about food. Companies now need to cater to the millennial generation, as it has become their main target market.

                                For example if we buy a steak, we are supporting the meat industry. <i>How can design create transparency for consumers?</i> If we can design a long-term solution to protect our environment, then consumers can adapt to the new standards that we establish. The food industry does not want carbon labeling. Labeling in general is a threat to these industries. Thirty years ago, nutrition facts and labeling at restaurants were unheard of. Today, almost every restaurant has a nutrition facts page on its websites. Menus now list the number of calories in each dish. Carbon labeling already exists mainly in Europe. There are two major certification bodies: KRAV and the Swedish Seal were the first to develop a countrywide climate label policy for food<sup>6</sup>. Today, the U.K., France, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and even Japan, Australia, Thailand and South Korea have developed carbon labels which indicate carbon footprint in the form of CO2 equivalent<sup>7</sup>.

                                We need to introduce carbon labeling as well as support mandatory federal GMO labeling to set a new bar for transparency. It is time to reinvent the nutrition labels on food and identify the carbon emissions from that specific product. The U.K and Sweden have shown climate change initiatives that prove that this concept can be implemented, and, with the assistance of governments and industry, carbon labeling can be established on a larger scale. It is not a question of whether or not carbon labeling will be introduced in North America, but rather when it will arrive. To summarize, my goal is to create a long-term solution that consumers will adapt to. I want to make carbon footprint information easy to understand. I don’t think that we should limit this to the food industry; I believe that this should start in grocery stores and expand to every consumer good such as clothes, books, makeup, accessories and even cars. Design allows us to rethink what is considered “normal”. I want consumers to realize that

                                We must consider technology both as a problem and as a solution. While we might have used technology to design our own pathway to extinction, we can also use technology to design a solution for our species and the planet. “What if design is only design inasmuch as it challenges contemporary definitions of human? There ought to be recognition of precariousness as a shared condition of human life (indeed as a condition that links human and non-human animals)… Precariousness implies living socially, that is, the fact that one’s life is always in some sense in the hands of the other”<sup>8</sup>. (Colomina & Wigley 2016, p.107-124) <i>How can we demystify the idea of our dependency on others?</i> The common element between humans is the planet. If designers do not step up to this challenge, it is likely that no one will.

                                The roles in a design agency are traditionally divided into different functions and disciplines to assist a client or brand successfully. Some roles in an agency include: Account management who are the contact to the client; the buyer who predominately assists in finding clients and media; a strategist who focuses on the research; and the creatives who are the idea generators. Each role is essential and works together to better meet the needs of a client better. Throughout a design process, the most critical part of any project is not the people who work there, but the insight that is developed for the client’s project. The importance of insight into the design process allows an agency to grasp a better understanding of the customer and the marketplace. It provides a crucial connection to generating better ideas faster.

                                To fully understand any insight on any topic, it is essential to find out how insights are generated. Some strategies for pulling insight are through quantitative and qualitative research which allows strategists to understand better how the marketplace works and moves. One approach that I find is the most successful and most unthought-of is the connection between our sensory system and the emotional connection.  By tapping into the psychological and tactile connection that users have with a product or brand can allow for a user to have a more personal experience with our brand. Bill Bernbach, who was an American Creative Director of international advertising agency DDB, once said:

                                    </h2>

                                His belief of tapping into a consumer’s personal beliefs and lives has only proven success with his company and his work. <br>

                                With such a busy world of print, web, digital and social, it is no longer effective to hit consumers with just pretty images and type. Strategically planning, we can always assume what the best time and location are best for our target and correctly position ourselves accordingly, however winning over our consumer’s hearts and minds is trickier. As designers, we must analyze not only the consumer’s behavior but also the environment, mindset, and personal passions1. This can be achieved successfully by connecting to the five senses: smell, touch, sight, sound, and taste.<br>

                                According to researchers Dr. L.D. Rosenblum, new studies reveal that there is surprising power and reach to our senses4. Our brains use complete forms of perceptual information of which most people are unaware of4. But how much of our sense do we really use? Dr. L.D. Rosenblum says that we use 83.0% of Sight, 11.0% hearing, 3.5% smell, 1.5% touch and 1.0% of taste4.<br>

                                By allowing our sensory system to engage in a way that can possibly become more meaningful, the more easily we can connect and learn from them. Raw information enters our brains and eventually create meaning from previous experiences and past knowledge4. If we are mindful of our sense, we can use them to our advantage to help stimulate our minds and generate more insight and creative ideas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Designers need to find ways to unlock the less-conscious part of our brains and find ways to integrate all five senses (touch, sight, taste, smell, sound) into our methodological approach to gather more powerful insights2. For example, sight is one of the strongest out of the 5 senses. With sight, we are capable of seeing movement, colors, shape and multiple volumes of light. This allows us to experience the world in a more visual aspect. Touch will enable us to feel objects, texture, temperatures which will enable us to make connections and further investigate how an object lives. It is evident that when senses are used together, they allow for a stronger interpretation of what an object inevitably, is. We can all make judgements while using our sense as a unit. What if there was a way to alter our senses, to use them differently, to put insights further? <br>

                                There are ways to gather insights by unleashing a pathway into the less-conscious parts of our brains. By using something called disruptors, we can dig deeper into the way we think and process ideas and insights further than what we may see, touch and smell2. Disruptors are a way to force people to think outside of ordinary, to downplay the top-of-mind responses and to play with the multi-sensory experiences. We do this by separating our senses from how we typically use them and forcing us to use them differently2.

                                An example of this is called the “Touch and Describe” exercise. In a small experiment, I created a box that was covered and concealed, and on the inside of this box I built a miniature abstract sculpture that was non- identifiable. Once the box and object were created, I had asked people to place their hands into the box and feel the object with their hands. The purpose of using an abstract non- identifiable sculpture, was to have a clear feel of an unknown object and to make the user trust their sense of touch. Different textures were used to allow the user to try and identify they object with past experiences of texture that they may have encountered. During this process, they were asked what they had felt or what they were feeling. Once they were comfortable with the shape of the object, I then asked them to draw what they had felt. Once they completed their drawing, the object was revealed. Most of the users’ reactions were shocked and surprised and had variations of answers as to what the object was. In this experiment, the disruptor was that the only tool they were allowed to use were their sense of touch. If this were to be used to generate insight on a brand or client, the descriptive words could be used as the baseline for developing ideas and insights. For example, if they used a word like sticky, this could create an insight on how the product is used or how users thought sticky was a negative, as they didn’t like the way it felt.

                                There are many different types of disruptors and techniques that can help provide better access to the five senses. They can help dig deep into the minds of users and help impact design and how consumers really experience and think about things. These tools can help broaden the language between our senses and insight and further create an experience that is remembered through our design; it just depends on how far you’re willing to dig in the less-conscious mind and explore your senses.

                                My educational and professional experience in architecture absolutely shaped the way I think and act through my design process, but I have always looked at architecture without the actual ambition of designing buildings. Rather, I’ve been fascinated by architecture – and its fundamental language, representation – as a form of visualization, that could be objective or imaginative, honest or exaggerated, depicting the built environment or the idea for a future project. What drew me to architecture was, at the deepest level, an interest towards drawing as a form of knowledge: a methodology that could be applied to any scale, from interior design to the urban environment. The strong passion I developed for graphic design made me decide to shift my focus from architecture, and after many explorations I realized that the disciplines of information design and data visualization deeply resonated with my way of thinking about – and understanding – concepts.

                                Thus, I started the program determined to learn more about these topics, but without a clear direction for my research project. Studio classes, seminars and readings in the program have been critical in helping me reflect about my topics of interest, and I decided to further incorporate them in my design work, investigating them from the point of view of information design. This very free exploration brought me to what I think is a very important understanding about myself. I have been drawn to maps since I was a child, studying them, drawing on them and collecting them up to this day, but for some reason I had never thought about this as something that I could somehow incorporate into my practice. I quickly realized that most of the works I had developed since the start of the MDES program followed a common thread: they were – of reflected upon – acts of map-making. I am convinced that this reflection on my design work allowed me to identify a valuable theoretical background to support the future steps in my research.
                                The instinct to explore and understand the world around us by mapping is, quoting writer and curator Katharine Harmon, <i>“like our opposable thumbs, […] part of what makes us human.”</i><sup>1</sup>
                                I believe that the strive to visualize information responds to one of the most important challenges for designers: we have the responsibility to raise awareness on what is going on in the world, whether it is a massive change, an urgent problem or an innovation opportunity – because spreading knowledge is the first step towards change.

                                I’m interested in investigating the interaction between graphic design and space, and how our perception of space is mediated by the visualizations we produce to represent it – mapping being just one of many possible methodologies. The work of artists such as Barbara Kruger<sup>2</sup>, or of practices like 2x4<sup>3</sup> really inspire me in reflecting about how graphic design can activate, transform space, and open it to new meanings. I’m drawn to explore these subjects in relation to the space of the city, seen as a materialization of social, economical, political processes. Today, data regarding these issues are more abundant and easier to collect than ever: being inspired by the work of designers such as David McCandless<sup>4</sup>, Nicholas Felton<sup>5</sup>, Jer Thorp<sup>6</sup>, I plan to expand my knowledge about the basic concepts of data science and to explore the ways it can interact with graphic design. Other disciplines I want to look into regarding the interaction between space and design are anamorphism, augmented reality and spatial media: I think they all offer opportunities for an interventions of design on the urban environment, to generate, citing Michael Rock (among the founders of 2x4), a <i>“hyperlinking to the landscape.”</i><sup>7</sup>

                                During our group visit to the EDIT exhibition<sup>8</sup> in Toronto, I was really impressed by a work of art titled <i>SOS (Save Our Souls) Shelter</i>, by the 16-year-old Greek artist Achilleas Souras: a shelter similar to a small igloo completely made out of life vests left on the Mediterranean beaches by refugees escaping from their countries. The recent migrant crisis is an issue that I feel particularly close because of the deep involvement of my native country in it, resulting on one hand in great generosity from rescuers and citizens, but on the other in an unprecedented wave of intolerance and hate. What I’m really interested in is how the information about this very complex issue is almost always presented in an over-simplified manner in mass media, and how in their fast diffusion on the web they get distorted – if not fabricated from scratch – fomenting ignorance and violence. I wonder if design can address these issues, at least to raise awareness and help people see an urgent problem like this from a more human perspective, like the Italian designers Francesca Fragapane and Alex Piacentini did in their recent web project <i>The Stories Behind a Line – a visual narrative of six asylum seekers routes</i><sup>9</sup>. Since I’m interested in information design and data visualization, I think this could be another possible direction for the development of my MDES Thesis.

                                Being both a designer and a trained musician, I always thought about the design process as something related to the musical composition process, reflecting about their similar dynamics and strategies. At the same time, my interest for mapping and visualization brought me to wonder about the possibilities of visualizing non-visual perceptions and music in particular. I am deeply inspired by the work of the Greek artist Iannis Xenakis, who in his career constantly crossed the borders between architecture, design and music, producing a seminal research on the visualization of sounds. Today, the boundaries between design and music seem to get more and more blurred: an eloquent example is the birth of the professional role of sound designer<sup>10</sup>. There are many examples of research directly related to my field of interests that I am looking into, such as scientific studies on chromesthesia<sup>11</sup>, on the graphic perception of sounds, or music visualization projects like the one<sup>12</sup> recently published by Giorgia Lupi and her Accurat team in collaboration with musician Kaki King, which investigates questions such as <i>“can we feel data? and can we see music?”</i> Thus, I think this could be a third hypothetical direction for my research, in which I could focus on the interaction between music, design and space, the possibility to blur the line between visual and auditive perception, and the challenge of extracting data from sounds, with the goal of analyzing and visualizing them.

                                My current research interests are in applying my artistic expertise and multi-cultural background into design, specifically, making motion graphics. Drawing has been my main way to explore curiosity. With regards to my illustrations, I hope to explore ink brush painting within motion graphic. My passion for traditional Chinese art was fostered when I was a child. For me, the loose brush strokes and sensitive colours of ink painting can powerfully evoke the moods and intentions.

                                Evoking the primitive childish desire to explore the unknown and happiness has always been my passion of creating things. More specifically, the human’s immanent desire of fear, pain, delight, existence and negative pleasure (the so-called sublime affect) in this postmodern ear.<sup>1</sup> Now, we are all experiencing the whole sense of fluctuating identity, there is no stable ground to make sense of the world.<sup>2</sup> The everyday experience of ‘stuplimity’ which combines boredom and astonishment, banality and various negative emotions dulls our sensibility to space, time and even humanize when we “seamlessly articulate with an intelligent machine”.<sup>3</sup> However, the constantly pursuit of happiness and recognition of the unpresentable existence in the world is the ultimate energy for humans striving to live, affecting our emotion, energy, and relationship to the surrounding environment. Motion graphic’s ability as a “living media” brings all the awareness of surrounding world through transforming time and space into another immersive world.

                                I am now making motion graphic design and trying to explore the magical connection between the form transformation of motion graphic and post-human identity with the mediation of space and time. I see that there is no visible line between art and design, motion graphic design closely Interacts with fine art in both aesthetic and technical aspects. I am interested in motion graphics as a design medium, because it is a balanced interdisciplinary of different realms of design including illustration, typography, sign, color, sound and motion among others, designing a space for immersive experience. For me, although story telling is a fundamental element of traditional motion graphic, the most fantastic part of motion graphic is the shape transformation. More importantly, the motion graphics is a medium that can play with space and time.  I believe that shape transformation is a metaphor for the fluctuating human inner sensibility and identity.  After study on the early exploration of experimental animations and shape transformation during the first half of 20th Century, I found that motion graphic is much more than conventional understanding of animation or title sequence.  I embrace ideas of “pure cinema” from 20s, which is similar to Hickcock’s statement of ‘pure cinema’ in film, and the treatment and understanding of the kinetic energy of shape and color, which even without any figurative object creates tension through transformation.

                                <p><br><br>Like most young children, I’ve had my fair share of outdoor adventures. Sometime in the summer of 1999 there is a little girl in bedazzled overalls examining a glittery trail on the sidewalk, wondering if that snail is really a fairy in disguise (<i>why else would it be shedding fairy dust?</i>). Rocks from the playground transformed into magical gems, and birds flying overhead became important messengers in my imagined stories of the animal world. My curiosity expanded far beyond creating stories, and my parents were ever too happy to indulge me in my quest to figure out how and why nature worked the way it did.

                                I was fascinated by the patterns I found in nature, from snowflakes on the window to the spots on the ladybugs I held. My mother and I would spend long hours asking each other questions about whatever caught our interest in the backyard or the park, and when we had come up with enough theories, we’d head to the library to see what we could learn. Nature and animals are a significant aspect of many children’s books, both fiction and nonfiction, and I am grateful to have grown up with a balanced view of both the scientific and the imagined representations of the natural world.</p>

                                    Our story, as humans, is the “story of our relationship with nature.”<sup>1</sup>
                                    While historically, our relationship has become troubled, in recent times it has made a move towards interdependency. Stories, which are fundamental to our human experience, can help make this shift to a balanced view of nature, by evoking within us a sense of <i>wildness</i> and of <i>wonder</i>.<sup>1</sup> Many of us are quite removed from nature and have not experienced the true wildness of it — the feeling of something grander, something that exists outside of our control, and yet has its own patterns and orders. I believe this is one reason for the way our society has become indifferent towards nature. Perhaps now that we have become disconnected from it, we no longer realize that we cannot expect the natural world to fit within our human rules and patterns. This awareness begins in childhood, when we are first learning about the world and becoming curious about the way it works.<sup>3</sup> Imaginative play, especially within nature, is crucial in developing our perspectives of the world.<sup>4</sup> In this way, it helps to <i>environmentally socialize</i> children, which is to teach them about the environment by modelling “positive perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards the environment.”<sup>5</sup></p>

                                <p>Growing up in a small town, I was lucky to have a deep connection with nature throughout the years. My summers were spent hiking the wooded trails near the river, and my autumns were spent running through the leafy undergrowth of the forest. As children, my sister and I would spend hours in the open grassy field behind our house, imagining all sorts of adventures as we crept up to butterflies and birds. Every spring, baby frogs would emerge under the flickering street lights and we would take turns “rescuing” them from cars. And in the winters, at the nature centre I volunteered at, we would turn sap into maple syrup and freeze it in the freshly fallen snow. This “easy relationship,” as Elliott calls it, established the natural world as a “place of bounty, beauty and safety.”<sup>6</sup></p>

                                <p>As I grew older, my fascination with nature evolved into an interest in its stewardship and conservation. I realized that these experiences are not always accessible within urban environments. Many developed are “human constructions in which nature is held at bay.”<sup>7</sup> The Greater Toronto Area does address this issue quite well in comparison to other cities, as there are green spaces well spread throughout—“Canadians are not afraid of nature, and cities are not garrisons…there is as much of nature in the city as there is out of it.”<sup>8</sup> However, as in any city, we are not as immersed in nature. In my undergraduate thesis, I addressed how this lack of immersion creates an atmosphere where even people who are interested in conservation and stewardship are not able to connect to the wildlife around them — we often champion for far-flung animals and causes, not knowing that there is so much to do right at home. My work focused on creating a system to encourage people to foster wildlife in their own backyard or balcony, creating a deeper connection with nature in our daily lives. Cities, after all, exist within nature like the rest of us.</p>

                                <p>The magic of nature, especially in our urban landscape, lies in its discovery. Like in Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic <i>The Secret Garden</i>, discovering nature, especially as a child, is like holding a key that unlocks your imagination. Elliott argues that <i>The Secret Garden</i> could be used to create “a model for discovery within, and reclamation of, the urban environment.”<sup>9</sup> The unexpected ways in which nature climbs into our city lives compel us to question, investigate, and form our own stories. This spark of curiosity and imagination is essential to foster a positive relationship with nature, and instill a sense of responsibility and the importance of environmental stewardship.</p>

                                <p>Incidental and unplanned encounters with nature are the inspiration for much of my work. These encounters may be mundane, like a line of geese marching across the road, or extraordinary, like catching a glimpse of an eagle soaring in the sky. My aim is to instill a sense of wonder and curiosity through my work, through visual storytelling that invites discovery.</p>

                                <p>The visual stories of nature I explored in my work this term revolved around the ways in which humans, and our built environment, interact with the natural world and its environment. Manmade forms, like geometric shapes and letterforms, intersect with the natural forms and organic shapes of wings and trees. I especially found myself drawn towards branching patterns, like the veins of a leaf or on a dragonfly wing, which look both organic and geometric. Typographically, I experimented with molding the uniform and geometric letters into flowing, organic forms.</p>

                                <p>The best way to examine our relationship with the natural world is to examine the stories we tell of our encounters with it, and the way nature and animals are constructed within these stories.<sup>10</sup> These stories may be in the form of urban legends, or new scientific discoveries. Historically, nature and wildlife have been depicted in folklore, fairytales, myths, and legends. These are often positioned as children’s stories, but they are quite telling of our human experience and cultures as a whole. Within illustrated books, the visual design of characters, places, and typography play a significant role in our perception of the natural world and the way we use it to “understand, add meaning to, and cope with our lives.”<sup>11</sup> Even as we have outgrown the forest villages of the past, our new modern cities aren’t as far from nature and wildlife as we would like to think. My final illustrations explore the kinds of stories that could be imagined in the modern world, at the intersection of city life and wild life.</p>

                               This essay explores the design of language, meaning and space. It attempts to find bridges between those concepts in relation to personal experiences of cultural hybridity, multifaceted identity and changing narratives. The work produced looks to explore these cross sections and it looks to visualize them through the mediums of space and typography, both in two dimensional and three dimensional forms. These explorations have been influenced by works of literature on identity, space and culture by writers in a diaspora such as Stuart Hall, Safia AlHillo, Georges Perec on his explorations of space and the theories of Roland Barthes in relation to semiotics. Ultimately the questions asked are how might we explore how designed space provides an opportunity for meaning to emerge? How might we bring physicality to these topics of meaning, language and cultural hybridity through design? And how does their being subjective affect this? How might a designed space respond to the subjectivity of experience? How might it through design allow for that subjectivity?

                                The multiplicity of culture and language is more than often a large part of the current identity. In relation to language we become basins for all the words, expressions and cultural proverbs that we borrow and that borrow us through time. Words have multiple layers of meaning because of an interweaving of cultures and languages. Our memories are triggered by an ever growing world of things. As an experience this becomes a multifaceted and sometimes confused existence. This is to say that we become multilayered. We reside in the intersection of a complex influx Venn diagram. This space is embedded in reality in the spaces we inhabit and our relationships.

                                My work began as an investigation of these topics of interest, as a method of visual research. Ultimately, they are an investigation of language for the bilingual speaker. They explore the abstraction of type and the flexibility of language. At some points language and text become visual forms which hold no meaning and at others they become bursts of memory. These explorations take from Perec’s ideas in ‘Species of Spaces’ where he states that ‘this is how space begins, with words only, signs traced on the blank page.”<sup>3</sup> In addition to space, Perec’s works also explore themes of identity, loss and absence. His use of language as a play, and as a game allowed for his mapping of the spaces around us, moving from the most intimate to the public. Perhaps, Perec is an influence for the connections between language, space and experience.

                                 In relation to the notion of a text, Roland Barthes expresses the idea of the text allowing meaning to emerge and explode. In that he states “The text is not a coexistence of meanings but a passage, an overcrossing; thus it answers not to an interpretation, even a liberal one but to an explosion, a dissemination.” If we were to consider this as a description of space, it brings up questions of how space might allow meaning to emerge and how sense of place is ultimately created through the “stereographic plurality of its weave.”<sup>1</sup>

                                Similar to text, space is also a tissue, a woven fabric of both physical and non-physical stimulants. The meaning generated within that space or in the cross-sections of spaces, similar to culture is performative in its nature, perhaps at a much faster and momentary pace.

                                Additionally, Barthes used the term “play”<sup>1</sup> to refer to the flexibility of text that allowed multiple interpretations in reading. This is interesting in relation to the cross-sections of Arabic and English meanings and translation. How can the freedom of language give the reader the opportunity to generate their own multiple meanings from text? By recognizing the power of language to shape and reshape our own individual realities, how can that be applied to an exploration of bilingual hybridity?

                                In an attempt to bridge this to identity, In ‘Minimal Selves’ Stuart Hall expresses that ‘identity insists on difference…every identity is placed positioned, in a culture, a language and a history.”<sup>2</sup> He describes this difference as the production of a ‘new space’ for identity. It is interesting that he uses the words, ‘placed’ and ‘positioned’ which allow for some physicality to the concept of identity, this provides the possibility for the exploration of space and place making for a diaspora. Hall further expands on this notion of difference in forming identity:

                                “Identity is formed at the unstable point where the ‘unspeakable’ stories of subjectivity meet the narratives of history, of a culture. And since he/she is positioned in relation to cultured narratives which have been profoundly expropriated the colonized subject is always somewhere else’ doubly marginalized, displaced always other than where he or she is, or is able to speak from.”<sup>2</sup>

                                Hall uses himself as a case study for his work which was developed over the course of decades with a particular political and social culture and historical context. His idea of ‘unspeakable’ stories and the meeting of narratives of history at an unstable point provides an intangible complexity to the diaspora identity. This complexity places challenges for the emergence of meaning through space or through design. Moreover, What is interesting in this is how an individual’s experience can be relatable to many in the diaspora. Identity is multifaceted and while personal, it is also shared. “Many people recognize themselves in the narratives of displacement,”<sup>2</sup> but also “all identity is constructed across difference and begins to live with the politics of difference.”<sup>2</sup>

                                This is ultimately why bilingual culture feeds into this creation of meaning and of the experience of space. There is a space where English and Arabic become seamless however, more than often this translation fails and that mirrors our experiences with the overlap of languages. Sometimes we do not survive translation, there is a difficulty in expression and there are glitches that occur in a bilingual mind. Similarly, Sudanese- American poet Safia AlHillo, looks at the cross-sections of language and identity, she explores the work of various hybrid poets where:

                                AlHilo and other writers of diaspora have pondered this use of the colonialist’s language to express notions that are ‘foreign’. This loss in translation is an area worth exploring in relation to design. There is an adaptation of language that is not always successful, these writers borrow the English language with an attempt to mould it into their own method of expression. There are questions here about how culture is borrowed and how that relates to my questions of cultural hybridity? In a way cultural hybridity come to exists because of this borrowing. AlHillo also expands on concepts of home; “Home is not a ready-made location, determined by one’s birth, but an active construction.”<sup>4</sup> AlHillo presents the option of “home as a portable environment… a decision, a project, rather than a country.”<sup>4</sup> This transformative and elusive nature of home can perhaps be translated into a physical experience, which would then allow for the design of space and place.

                                How does this recreation of culture through language by a diaspora affect experience of place? In Micheal Rock’s ‘Graphic Design in the Expanded field’, he explains that graphic design has allowed for “the activation do spaces, sometimes temporarily and its power lies in that it is temporary as opposed to the seeming permanence of architecture”.<sup>5</sup>  Looking at this through the lens of cultural hybridity how can how design can shape spatial and social interactions of space? And how can language influence semiotic moments linked to the narrative of a space? Design, like Barthes’ text can create conditions for something to emerge. I am interested in this idea of creative production being a culturally and socially transformative medium. This is the key influence on my interests for my thesis, the idea of meaning emerging through space or through design. My background and unfixed identity plays a large role in how this meaning is entirely illusive in nature and subjective to the person within the experience. We inherently absorb things that occur around us to the point where they ultimately become a part of who we are, which relate to AlHillo’s ideas of home being a constructed place. How might I as a designer and a researcher respond to this performative nature of place making and generative meaning within a public of diaspora.

                                Dark corners, the smell of leather, screams of pleasure and clanking of chains—all design—creating an eroticism and fixation towards this so-called “fetish” culture. As much as fetish is driven by the user’s endorphin it’s also a performance. From the tools being used: gage-balls, floggers, whips, and cuffs to the relationship of master and slave everything is designed to let the user experience a rush of emotions. <br>

                                Design in this sense is both materials based and performative. The feeling of a leather flogger slapping you on the back—maybe you’re enjoying it—from the way it’s held to the way it has to swing. These rules which are created to make sure there is a safe and consent way of acting when participating in a fetish relationship. But also the performative nature of how the master/misters will walk around the room—commanding assertively—the submissive slave to follow, act and participate. <br>

                                All these things are designed for the user, to potentially “get off”—this could be quite aggressive; not all fetish relationships involve a sexual pleasure. Sometimes to “get off” can be a releasing of endorphins, bottled up inside waiting to ease all the tension away from the body. Design plays a significant role in the fetish culture, both to educate the way of being in a fetish relationship, as well as how to experience a fetish. In the same time fetish is designed to be performed, in the same way how gender can be performed, but also can be performative. Judith Butler states:
                            </p>

                                        When we say gender is performed we usually mean that we've taken on a role or we're acting in some way and that our acting or our role playing is crucial to the gender that we are and the gender that we present to the world.

                                        To say that gender is performative is a little different because for something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects.

                                        We act and walk and speak and talk in ways that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman.

                                In a way fetish is designed to be performed within gender. Roles of power are placed upon individuals, making it performative for them to have control in their everyday lives. But then fetish comes along and the roles of power start to change, people seem to put on a new mask and showcase their inner desires. In a way roles of dominance and submission start to blur the lines of gender and the performative nature of fetish begins to appear. In addition to designing our gender roles, we now have to understand how to design roles when it comes to having a fetish.

                                For a moment let’s think about how aggressive these sayings are and relate it to the fact society has designed “fetish” to be represented in a dark, horrific and aggressive way. The types of visual representation consist of wearing tight and provocative leather outfits, having some kind of GIMP mask, being locked/tied or gagged with objects, and being either being hyper-sexual or hyper-masculine. Visual culture is representing fetish as something extremely sexual, when in reality sometimes to have a fetish can mean enjoying the beauty of the object. Leaving many people confused and asking, what is a fetish? Is a fetish wanting to be slapped and diminished, treated like an object of affection or even getting aroused by the sight of an object? Or could a fetish be having a hyper-masculine male or female do things to your body and you have no say or control over the situation. Making fetish to be this universal concept which ties into everything and anything. By definition, in <i>The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality—fetish</i>:

                                        A profound feeling that a human being has for an inanimate object, activity, or situation. It may be a deep erotic desire for something, often clothing, such as high heels, a belt, bra, or burqa; or a body part, such as a woman's breast, foot, or hair. One may also have a fetish for an activity, like spanking or being watched; or a situation, such as a mistress–slave or doctor–patient relationship. Whatever the fetish object, activity, or situation, the fetishist invests great power in it—sometimes great sexual power, sometimes great religious power, and sometimes a mixture of both.

                                Even then this explanation, doesn’t fully justify what fetish is. It states the obvious that a fetish is an “activity and situation,” but it neglects to show that a fetish doesn’t have to be related to anything sexual. We are left to wonder do we really know what a fetish is? There might be a way for design to make fetish less aggressive than what it looks like through visual representation.

                                Surface is what immediately brings the visual attention of a user to design. In modernity, surface is often a smooth, slick and flat plane that represents the ideology of rationality and order. As form and function are the top priorities in modern design, the emotional aspect of design is intentionally or unintentionally void. The surface becomes a blank canvas, a minimalist territory that leaves so much space to create, not just from the perspective of visual aesthetics and individual presentation, but also a space to connect design and users in the realm of emotion. The modernist may argue that surface design is an ornament or decoration that does not serve one’s need and functionality. However, at present, the overwhelming material world does not given our souls satisfaction. Our affection for objects has shifted greatly in favour of our emotional needs and comfort. A sense of belonging, self-esteem, fulfillment and happiness is what we really desire in design.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs<sup>1</sup> in psychology, he used the terms "physiological," "safety," "belonging" , "love," "esteem," "self-actualization," and "self-transcendence" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through.<sup>2</sup>  This theory has been applied to design with transformed terminology: functionality, reliability, usability, pleasure, and meaning. The top two levels of this pyramid structure are combined with emotion, the functionality and usability stay at the base level of human needs.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The users’ first contact with surface is the visual language of the design presentation: color, shape, texture, pattern, and also the structural shape of the surface.
                                Surface design is an extension of rhetorical visual elements that affect the users’ visual senses. The design composition creates a visual language that connects viewer’s attention and interest to the design. It is the visual equivalent of starting with a simple greeting or an introduction. This contact creates an initial interest in an exchange of information that leads to a deeper understanding. Similarly, surface design functions as an introduction to the entire object, creating a visual communication and an emotional connection to the viewers.<sup>3</sup>

                                To users, surface design is an introduction, a visual communication through the eyes to the heart, an affect of an emotional journey from unconsciousness to consciousness. For designers, surface design is an opportunity to express the designer’s passion into a visual representation. It is a process to connect the designer’s idea, belief and passions to users through visual expression.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So the surface design provides a large space for the designer and users to communicate in this realm. If we see the surface itself is a media space. Designers traditionally use this space to create meaning and communicate with users visually. However, while users have immediate reactions to the surface design, designers need relatively longer time to receive feedback from the users. Semiotically, the graphic message can also be interpreted differently in different contexts. Thus, although the designer has control over the design, the designer has no way to control the effectiveness of the design and how users reflect the design emotionally. So, the reality is, relying on the designer’s authority to provide the emotional needs of users in design is unpredictable.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If we consider surface design in the concept of post-structuralism,<sup>4</sup> in the context of linguistics, users can choose how they construct and combine words in different ways to express their individuality. If we adopt this concept in design, can we use surface as a canvas for users to express themselves and communicate with designs? If so, how can design provide users the freedom but also give designers to the ability to control the spirit of the design? How can surface design create a visual conversation that invites the users to collaborate in the design process? How can surface design create opportunities for users to express their individual sense? These questions lead to the exploration of the theory of customization in surface design.

                                In my 15 years of commercial art practice as an airbrush artist and a custom designer, I have created many  “one of a kind design” and “custom experience” for users in all types of surfaces. No matter the design is a high-end custom painting on a sports-car, or it is a simple everyday object such as a T-shirt design. My job is closely working together with the user, to help them to express their uniqueness through the design process. Surface design is always the first priority for my customers to claim their individuality and self-expression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ability to customize a design with personal experience is rapidly increasing with today’s technology. From desktop publishing to CNC; laser technology, online media and social platform. Users can have many choices to design and product personalized design with high customization, in both tangible and digital forms. Surface design today also needs to adopt his design concept to provide users a platform for customization. Designers can use the surface as a design platform to collaborate with users,  designing tools and method for users to create their own customizable designs on different surfaces with the integrated DIY process. With customizable surfaces, users can express their emotion freely with provided forms and guidelines, which is the mainframe created in by designers. This collaboration in surface customization process can build a bridge between the material needs to the emotional aesthetic of the users, it also can create a prolonged visual conversation between designer and users.

                                Overall, surface design customization is user-centric: Designers collaborate with users to create designs individually. In this collaborative design method, both designer and user have the equal opportunity to make decisions on material needs and emotional needs. A democratic design process is a fundamental concept in this customizable design process, which may apply to other design areas.
                                More importantly, in a social context, the equality in design authority is achieved through this design practice, it can inspire users to explore their individual creative power and social participation.
                                Modernism’s ideology of “form follows function” avoids the surface design largely. The rational structures and clean, crisp and smooth surfaces reject the ornament and decoration of the surface design. In a way that it avoids the irrational feeling from our outside consciousness to the hidden emotion deep inside of us. The naked body and smooth skin of the modern surface give us a sense of order and coldness. Surface design is just the layer of clothing we need to warm our bodies and satisfy the need for our emotional comfort. After all, it is my belief that the purpose of design is for people, and the spirit of design is to provide people the true happiness.

                                This is a topic that might have been experienced by many, there are approximately one in four adults that has a mental illness worldwide. The issues of mental health have a long and complex history that could be dated back to the pre-biblical times when abnormal behaviors were perceived as possessed by evil spirits. As mental illnesses could be affecting one’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in various degrees, these symptoms depending on social context were often considered abnormal, and the individuals undergoing them are viewed as deviant. Of course what classifies are abnormal or deviant in a certain social context may not be classified as the same in another.<sup>1</sup>

                                Unlike diseases of the body, which could be attributed with definite biochemical or structural abnormalities, mental illness cannot be objectively diagnosed. Social constructionist presumes mental illnesses to be a mechanism of social control of deviant behavior, a system of segregation of institutionalization generated by psychiatrists with the authority to define, and label deviants.

                                Nevertheless, current society values an individual’s responsibility for their own mental health, which also considers mental health to be a complex medical issue of interwoven factors of biochemistry, genes, brain structural, psychological, biological, social, and environmental.<sup>2</sup></p>
                                <p>Accordingly, subjectivity and context relativity were immensely significant to the individual experiencing it, which creates complication in the process of identifying and categorizing mental illness. While researches and discourses regarding persons of mental illness were placing emphasis on the diagnosis, classification and treatment, my objective exists in disclosing the subjectivity of mental illness experiences and identity development through research and design. From express graphically the complexity of mental illness, the project intends to humanize mental illness, and individuals with mental illness, as well as to diminish stigmas and discriminations existed in the society. It’s crucial to remember that definitions of healthy or unhealthy are constantly changing as societies evolve and design has an imperative role in enhancing a better understanding of mental illness in the society.</p>

                                Individuals with mental illness face countless barriers and challenges in the present society, what affects them the most would be the stigma that’s associatively attached to mental illness.

                                <p>Stigma has become a marker for adverse experiences, which includes, a sense of shame, blame, and secrecy in the self-stigmatization process. Studies have shown that individuals with mental illness are making efforts to conceal the illness from others. Family and friends also endure stigma by association, often referred to as “courtesy stigma.”</p>

                                <p>The process of stigmatization is a process of devaluation, individual with mental illness takes on the social role of being “mental ill”. Akin to physical disabilities, this is a label that generates a self-defining state, denies them the perspective of being capable in other social roles, such as parent, spouse, or employee. Public declaration will reconstruct labeled individual’s social interaction, either making them vulnerable to discrimination or limiting their participation in society. They are usually not expected to engage in social activities, such as employment or romantic relationships.<sup>3</sup></p>
                                <p> While mass media might be the most powerful tool in distributing information, it directly affects societal perspective and understanding of mental health. Implications of often negative portrayals, or inaccurate presentation regarding mental illness, causes misunderstandings, confusion and conflict. Consequently, it could delay help and treatment for people in need, or it could push them to the fringes of society living in isolation.<sup>4</sup></p>

                                Mass media frequently display mental illness in its worst state. While bringing the issues into the public’s attention, it overlooks the fact that, like physical condition, there are varying degrees to an illness, it could completely affect a person’s life, or it could be merely part of their life. Yet, the majority of the population living “normal” life with mental illness were under-represented in the mass media, making the labeling harder to obliterate.</p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, many people with a mental health condition also have co-existing physical conditions, often leading to decreased stamina or dexterity restrictions which can make everyday living more demanding.<sup>5</sup> Their living needs should be brought into public attention, and design should be playing a role in the improvement of their lives. The proposition of this research project is to embrace an affirmative perspective on mental health and encourage an attitude toward treating mental health issues equally as physical issues. Simultaneously arise the notion that mental illness should not define the Individual that’s living with it. After all, mental illness was now similar to any other physical condition and could be treated.
